Overview
The Student Management System is a simple yet effective Python project developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It helps manage basic student information such as name, roll number, and marks, and performs operations like displaying student details, updating marks, and generating results. This project is designed to be clean, easy to understand, and exam-friendly, making it ideal for beginners and academic submissions.

Project Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the practical use of Python OOP concepts by building a real-world application that manages student records in a structured and reusable manner.

Class & Object – Represents students as real-world entities 
Constructor (__init__) – Initializes student attributes
Encapsulation – Groups data and methods into a single unit
Methods – Performs operations on student data
